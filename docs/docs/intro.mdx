# Start here

First, why would you use Eventuous instead of rolling out your own library to support Event Sourcing? From our experience, doing that is totally possible, but it's laborious, time-consuming, and prone to failure.

## Do you need it?

Watch this video to learn more about the motivation behind Eventuous:

Check out [The Right Way](prologue/the-right-way) to understand how things go wrong sometimes.

## Next steps

If you are convinced that Eventuous is the right tool for you, here are the next steps:
- Read the [Prologue](prologue/introduction) to learn what Eventuous provides
- Learn more about the basic building blocks:
  - [Domain model](domain) components
  - [Persistence](persistence) for events, and how it differs from the traditional approach
  - [Application service](application) components
  - [Subscriptions](subscriptions) for event processing (like [read models](read-models))
- Check sample applications to see how Eventuous is used in practice:
  - [EventStoreDB](https://github.com/eventuous/dotnet-sample) sample
  - [PostgeSQL](https://github.com/eventuous/dotnet-sample-postgres) sample
