Producers, along with [Subscriptions](../subscriptions/), are the foundation of the Eventuous' messaging system.

## Concept

Although an [event store](../persistence/event-store) produces events too, it is normally used via the [Aggregate store](../persistence/aggregate-store). Sometimes, you just need to produce arbitrary messages, which aren't necessarily events. For example, you can also produce commands. Still, the main purpose of a producer is to put events to an event database or a broker, so they can be consumed by a subscription.

Within Eventuous, the main purpose of producers is to support [gateways](../gateway), and, through gateways, enable creation of [connectors](/docs/connector/).
