# Diagnostics

Eventuous provides built-in metrics and traces for:
- Event store
- Subscriptions, consumers, and event handlers
- Command services

The built-in diagnostics integrate with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

The documentation for diagnostics is not complete yet. Please refer to the [samples](https://github.com/eventuous/dotnet-sample) for now. You can also find more information about diagnostics for subscriptions on the [subscriptions diagnostics](../subscriptions/subs-diagnostics) page.
