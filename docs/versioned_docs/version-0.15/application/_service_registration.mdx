If you registered an implementation of  `IEventStore` in the DI container, you can also register the command service:

```csharp title="Program.cs"
builder.Services.AddCommandService<BookingCommandService, BookingState>();
```

The `AddCommandService` extension will register the `BookingService`, and also as `ICommandService<BookingState>`, as a singleton. Remember that all the DI extensions are part of the `Eventuous.Extensions.DependencyInjection` NuGet package.

When you also use `AddControllers`, you get the command service injected to your controllers.

You can simplify your application and avoid creating HTTP endpoints explicitly (as controllers or minimal API endpoints) if you use the [command API feature](command-api.md).
