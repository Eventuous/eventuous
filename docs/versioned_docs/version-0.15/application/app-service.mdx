## Concept

:::note
This page describes command services that work with [aggregates](../domain/aggregate.md). If you are not using aggregates, check the [Functional services](func-service.mdx) page.
:::


The command service itself performs the following operations when handling one command:
1. Extract the aggregate id from the command, if necessary.
2. Instantiate all the necessary value objects. This could effectively reject the command if value objects cannot be constructed. The command service could also load some other aggregates, or any other information, which is needed to execute the command but won't change state.
3. If the command expects to operate on an existing aggregate instance, this instance gets loaded from the [event store](../persistence/event-store.md).
4. Execute an operation on the loaded (or new) aggregate, using values from the command, and the constructed value objects.
5. The aggregate either performs the operation and changes its state by producing new events, or rejects the operation.
6. If the operation was successful, the service persists new events to the store. Otherwise, it returns a failure to the edge.

## Implementation

Eventuous provides a base class for you to build command services. It is a generic abstract class, which is typed to the aggregate type. You should create your own implementation of a command service for each aggregate type. As command execution is transactional, it can only operate on a single aggregate instance, and, logically, only one aggregate type.

:::note
Add `Eventuous.Application` NuGet package to your project.
:::

The base class for aggregate-based command services is `CommandService<TAggregate, TState, TId>`.

### Handling commands

The base class has one function that must be used in the service class constructor to define how the service will handle commands. The function is called `On<TCommand>` where `TCommand` is the command type. You can add as many command handlers as you need. The `On` function composes a command handler builder that allows to chain further details to describe how the command needs to be processed.

After calling `On`, add two more calls to the builder:
* `InState(ExpectedState)` to specify what is the expected aggregate state is. For example, if the `BookRoom` command expects that no booking exists with a given identity, you'd specify `InState(ExpectedState.New)`. There are three possible states: `New`, `Existing`, and `Any`.
* `GetId(Func<TCommand, TId>)` to explain the service how to use one or more properties of `TCommand` type to compose an identity object for loading and storing the aggregate state.

After that, use one of the `Act` functions to specify the business logic of the command handler. There are two available functions for it: `Act` and `ActAsync`.

Here is an example of a command service form our test project:

```csharp title="BookingService.cs"
public class BookingsCommandService 
    : CommandService<Booking, BookingState, BookingId> {
    public BookingsCommandService(
        IEventStore store, 
        Services.IsRoomAvailable isRoomAvailable
    ) : base(store) {
        On<BookRoom>()
            .InState(ExpectedState.New)
            .GetId(cmd => new BookingId(cmd.BookingId))
            .ActAsync(
                (booking, cmd, _) => {
                    var period = new StayPeriod(
                        LocalDate.FromDateTime(cmd.CheckInDate), 
                        LocalDate.FromDateTime(cmd.CheckOutDate)
                    ),
                    booking.BookRoom(
                        cmd.GuestId,
                        new RoomId(cmd.RoomId),
                        stayPeriod,
                        new Money(cmd.BookingPrice, cmd.Currency),
                        new Money(cmd.PrepaidAmount, cmd.Currency),
                        DateTimeOffset.Now,
                        isRoomAvailable
                    );
                }
            );

        On<RecordPayment>()
            .InState(ExpectedState.Existing)
            .GetId(cmd => new BookingId(cmd.BookingId))
            .Act((booking, cmd) => 
                booking.RecordPayment(
                    new Money(cmd.PaidAmount, cmd.Currency), 
                    cmd.PaymentId, 
                    cmd.PaidBy, 
                    DateTimeOffset.Now
                ));
    }
}
```
