### Result

The command service will return an instance of `Result<TState>`. It can be inspected using the following members:

| Signature                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bool TryGet(out Result<TState>.Ok ok)`                                    | Returns `true` if the result is successful and also returns `Result<TState>.Ok` as the `out` variable.                                                                              |
| `bool TryGetError(out Result<TState>.Error error)`                         | Returns `true` if there was an error. The `error` then gets assigned to an instance of `Error` that contains more details about what went wrong.                                    |
| `bool Success`                                                             | Returns `true` if the result is successful.                                                                                                                                         |
| `Exception? Exception { get; }`                                            | Returns an exception instance if there was an error, or `null` if there was no exception.                                                                                           |
| `void ThrowIfError()`                                                      | Throws the recorded exception if there was an error, does nothing otherwise.                                                                                                        |
| `T Match<T>(Func<Ok, T> matchOk, Func<Error, T> matchError)`               | Can be used for pattern matching success and error if the output has the same type. Eventuous uses this function for producing `IResult` and `ActionResult` in HTTP API extensions. |
| `void Match<T>(Action<Ok> matchOk, Action<Error> matchError)`              | Allows to execute code branches based on the result success.                                                                                                                        |
| `Task MatchAsync<T>(Func<Ok, Task> matchOk, Func<Error, Task> matchError)` | Allows to execute async code branches based on the result success.                                                                                                                  |

When using `TryGet`, you get the `Ok` instance back, which contains the following properties:

| Property               | Description                                                                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TState State`         | New state instance                                                                                       |
| `Change[] Changes`     | List of new events. `Change` struct contains both the event payload and its type.                        |
| `ulong StreamPosition` | Position of the last event in the stream that can be used for tracking, for example, read model updates. |

The `Match` function also provides `Ok` for the `matchOk` function to use.

When using `TryGetError`, you get the `Error` instance back, which contains the following properties:

| Property               | Description                                                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `string ErrorMessage`  | The error message, which can be custom or taken from the exception. |
| `Exception? Exception` | Exception details if available.                                     |
