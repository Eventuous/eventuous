# Eventuous

Event Sourcing library for .NET, which is:
- Somewhat volatile as breaking changes keep coming in
- ~Very~ Somewhat opinionated
- [EventStoreDB](https://eventstore.com)-oriented
- .NET-friendly (decent DI, logging, and diagnostics support)

## Documentation

It might be not up to date as we are currently solidifying the codebase. 
This work leads to many breaking changes, and the documentation will get updated when the codebase stabilises.
